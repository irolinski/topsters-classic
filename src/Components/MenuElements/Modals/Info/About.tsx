        Topsters Classic is a <b>hobby project</b> that I have made, channeling
        my <b>nostalgia for the original Topsters page</b> that I've used as a
        teen lurking music forums circa 2013. <br /> <br />
        The design of the charts is{" "}
        <b>recreated from the original charts designs</b>
        and the credit for them is due to the developer of the original app. The{" "}
        <b>UI is designed from scratch</b> for it to be up to today's standards;
        especially in regards to mobile use. <br /> <br />
        The code is{" "}
